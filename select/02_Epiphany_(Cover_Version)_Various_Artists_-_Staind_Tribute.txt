I tried my best
To love you in the way
That I thought it'd be best

Would've given anything
No, even everything
'Cause you were my everything

But the more I loved you like that
The more I lost myself right in this mess
In the mask that never loses its smile
I found knowing myself less and less

I'm the one I should love
In this world
See the light in my soul that shines ever so bright
Something that I knoe now
So I love me
To see the beauty in the missing puzzle piece

I'm the one I should love

The road ahead might be dark but walk it step by step
On the way meet the one who you've chosen to accept

Why did I leave myself all alone in the cold and dark for so so long
What did I fear so much to hide my true self where it did not belong

I'm the one I should love
In this world
See the light in my soul that shines ever so bright
Something that I know now
So I love me
To see the beauty in the missing puzzle piece

I'm the one I should love

I might be a little rough
Just around the edges
You might think that I might be anything but special
But this is who I am
I'm the only one for me
I look at all of it
My arms and legs, my heart and my one soul

I wanna love it all
In this world
See the light in my soul that shines ever so bright
Something that I know now
So I love me
To see the beauty in the missing puzzle piece

I'm the one I should love
I'm the one I should love
I'm the one I should love
