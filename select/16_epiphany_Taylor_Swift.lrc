[00:32.77] Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
[00:42.86] Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
[01:01.36] 
[00:55.77] Crawling up the beaches now
[01:00.66] "Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
[01:05.52] And some things you just can't speak about
[01:26.52] 
[01:13.61] With you, I serve
[01:15.45] With you, I fall down, down
[01:23.84] Watch you breathe in
[01:25.78] Watch you breathing out, out
[01:39.78] 
[01:33.85] Something med school did not cover
[01:44.19] Someone's daughter, someone's mother
[01:57.32] Holds your hand through plastic now
[02:02.18] "Doc, I think she's crashing out"
[02:06.83] And some things you just can't speak about
[02:27.83] 
[02:35.19] Only 20 minutes to sleep
[02:38.35] But you dream of some epiphany
[02:45.53] Just one single glimpse of relief
[02:48.27] To make some sense of what you've seen
[03:07.27] 
[02:55.87] With you, I serve
[02:57.95] With you, I fall down, down (down)
[03:05.86] Watch you breathe in
[03:07.86] Watch you breathing out, out
[03:21.86] 
[03:16.05] With you, I serve
[03:17.96] With you, I fall down (down), down (down)
[03:26.42] Watch you breathe in
[03:28.29] Watch you breathing out (out), out
[03:45.29] 
[03:36.43] Only 20 minutes to sleep
[03:39.95] But you dream of some epiphany
[03:46.74] Just one single glimpse of relief
[03:49.88] To make some sense of what you've seen
