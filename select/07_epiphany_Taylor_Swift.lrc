[00:32.70] Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
[00:42.89] Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
[01:01.39] 
[00:55.72] Crawling up the beaches now
[01:00.68] "Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
[01:05.55] And some things you just can't speak about
[01:26.55] 
[01:13.62] With you, I serve
[01:15.41] With you, I fall down, down
[01:23.82] Watch you breathe in
[01:25.79] Watch you breathing out, out
[01:39.79] 
[01:33.87] Something med school did not cover
[01:44.15] Someone's daughter, someone's mother
[01:57.04] Holds your hand through plastic now
[02:02.11] "Doc, I think she's crashing out"
[02:06.85] And some things you just can't speak about
[02:27.85] 
[02:35.10] Only 20 minutes to sleep
[02:38.39] But you dream of some epiphany
[02:45.56] Just one single glimpse of relief
[02:48.28] To make some sense of what you've seen
[03:07.28] 
[02:55.84] With you, I serve
[02:57.68] With you, I fall down, down (down)
[03:05.82] Watch you breathe in
[03:07.85] Watch you breathing out, out
[03:21.85] 
[03:16.06] With you, I serve
[03:17.91] With you, I fall down (down), down (down)
[03:26.45] Watch you breathe in
[03:28.25] Watch you breathing out (out), out
[03:45.25] 
[03:36.43] Only 20 minutes to sleep
[03:39.98] But you dream of some epiphany
[03:46.74] Just one single glimpse of relief
[03:49.89] To make some sense of what you've seen
